            <p class="noIndex">One of the legends was that after the death of the concubine of Emperor Wudi of Han Dynasty, Liu Che, he sank into sad mourning, the alchemist from Qi, Shaoweng, carefully cut the portrait of Mrs. Li and lit a lamp candle in a square-curtain at night. When Emperor Wudi looked far away from another curtain, the portrait of Mrs. Li swayed like a living image. "Haiyang Zhuzhi Ci" (Hai Yang Poetry about Bamboo) formulated the story vividly, "decorating with lanterns and coloring hangings for drama renovation, hovering and wandering around the curtain to make it lifelike, She walked gently, step by step, with jades on, in front of the curtain, the Emperor saw Mrs. Li coming back to life."</p>
            <p class="noIndex">Until now, we found no data can clearly indicate that shadow has indeed appeared in Sui and Tang dynasties. But the data at least reveals that the technologies at that time had been very close to shadow. And according to the records, shadow reached a mature stage in the early Song Dynasty, so its formation in Sui and Tang dynasties was possible.</p>
            <p class="noIndex">The prosperity of shadow in Song Dynasty was dazzling. In April, 1127(the 2nd year of Jing Kang), Zhao Gou and other members of the royal family rushed south to establish the Southern Song Dynasty. At that time, the capital city of Lin'an (Hangzhou) became the center for shadow.</p>
            <p class="noIndex">In “Wa Si” (place for operas and plays) in the Northern Song Dynasty, the performances of “operas” were innumerable, one exclusive play of which was the shadow performance. At that time, there were a lot of famous artists, those who left names in the history were Dong Shiwu, Zhao Qi, Cao Baoyi and others. The ofﬁcials in Southern SongDynasty, imitated “Wa Si” in the former capital, Bianjing, and built many fun places called “Wa She” in the city of Lin'an for military ofﬁcers and recruited artists and performers. There gave birth to many famous shadow artists like Jia Silang, Wang Sheng, Wang Runqing. Fan Chengda, a poet in Southern Song Dynasty, once wrote a poem, “Gusu platform is forever prosperous since ancient times, but I favor Lantern Festival Shadow performance.”</p>
            <p class="noIndex">At that time, the contents of the shadow had divorced from the monotonous mode of publicity, the elements for performance increased greatly. In addition to historical stories, some of the works were purely ﬁctional, and the theatrical range of shadow plays became wider and wider. The materials of the shadow props were ﬁrst carved with paper and then changed to leather, perhaps for the considerations of its hardness. Shadow organizations such as the “Leather Portrait Society”—the organization for shadow performance, and trades such as “Shadow-carvers,” who mainly took the carving of the shadow puppets as their jobs, emerged. And taking the shadow plays as the center, the related industries developed.</p>
            <p class="noIndex">Yuan Dynasty was on the expansion to the westward from its very beginning. Shadow also spread westward as Shadow artists went along with the Mongolian army on its western expedition. It is recorded that the shadow was taken as a recreational activity within the army at that time. The tomb of Yuan Dynasty in 1298 (2nd year of Dade), discovered in 1955 in the east of the ancient city of Xiaoyi County, Shanxi Province, is marked with murals with images and paper windows on both sides of the tomb entrance, with the words “Music and shadow inherited in the family, keeping their duties together”. The shadow dramas of Jin and Yuan Dynasties inherited from what in the Song Dynasty. For example, the tomb of the 1st year Zhenglong of Jin Dynasty (1156), uncovered in 1980 in the Village of Yushuping, Xiaoyi County, Shanxi Province, had murals with shadow puppets. In the Manjusri Hall of Yanshan Temple Fanshi County, Shanxi Province, the murals of the 7th year of Dading of Jin Dynasty (1167) painted a picture of children performing shadow plays; this is the portrait of the expansion of shadow to the remote areas of the North in Jin Dynasty.</p>
            <p class="noIndex">Ming Dynasty is an important period for shadow. In this period, shadow has completed two missions: one is that the various shadow schools became mature one after another; the other is the shadow strengthened its external communication. As the political center moved northward, shadows developed rapidly in Hebei Province. During Yongle, Wanli periods, shadow spread into Yunnan and other places, and combined with the local art forms, and formed its unique styles in singing, facial makeup and art production due to the reasons that Jiangnan, Hubei and Hunan provinces, Sichuan and the neighboring places became the military garrisons.</p>
            <p class="noIndex">The Qing Dynasty and the Republic of China witnessed the second peak in the history of development of the Chinese Shadow, and shadow plays reached most of the provinces in the country (Though no precise information about Xinjiang, Tibet, Guizhou, Guangxi and Hainan). After the Qing army entered the Shanhai Pass, the Manchu people enjoyed the shadow plays very much, in the palaces of the Eight Banners there were specially set shadow props, the artists were often invited by the Manchu nobility to perform in the palaces, called “the Palace Shadow Play”. In this period, there were two other theatrical troupes: one was the theatrical troupe for the palace; the other was for the wealthy families. In the late Qing Dynasty, there were also Shadow Drama Teahouses.In the period of the Republic of China, shadow was on the decay, and fewer people were engaged in shadow performance.In the Anti-Japanese War, the anti-Japanese national salvation propaganda, taking the form of shadow performance in Zhangzhou In the Anti-Japanese War, the anti-Japanese national salvation propaganda, taking the form of shadow performance in Zhangzhou Maolan and other famous artists, and set up the new Great Wall Shadow Society, innovated the repertoire, such as Yutian Joined the Army, the Road of Light, Blood and Tears, and so on, propagandized the struggles against the enemy, etc.</p>
            <p class="noIndex">After 1949, shadow gained attention and support from the government, there was a rapid revival in a short time. According to the incomplete statistics of the Ministry of Culture in 1955, at that time there were more than 900 shadow troupes and more than 5300 artists in various localities. In 1966, when the Cultural Revolution broke out, shadow puppets, like many other folk arts, were banned. After the end of the Cultural Revolution, in 1976, shadow plays resumed at an alarming rate, a situation that lasted for a short period of time. In the late 1980s, due to the depression of the performance market, many young and middle-aged shadow artists quit the stage and changed their jobs to make a living. This is also the reason why today's actors are out of line.</p>
