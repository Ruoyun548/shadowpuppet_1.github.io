                </h5>
                <div class="content">
                    Leathering is the beginning of shadow making. Spring is the best time for skin selection, soak the bloody fur in clear water for a few days, then tie the fur to a wooden frame, ﬂatten around with ropes, and scrape off the fur and other debris with a special knife. In order to make the skin look smooth and transparent, it often needs to be scratched several times. When the skin is ready, choose the leather material to its softness, hardness and thinness for carving, according to the different needs of the shadow puppets' head, neck, waist, arm, foot, waist or the combination of the two.

                <div class="content">
                    The original design of the shadow puppets was painted on paper, and the sketches used in making the shadow were called the “sample pedigrees”, which were handed down by the artists of all dynasties. Like the shadow scripts, paper sample pedigrees are not easy to preserve, so there are very few samples handed down from Ming and Qing dynasties today.

                <div class="content">
                    Transcribing the drawing from the paper to the skin is called drafting, also called marking. Place all kinds of patterns for carving, such as faces, dress, and props and so on, under the transparent leather, then use a small steel needle to draw the patterns on the leather. The scraped skin is then decomposed into parts, and after the skin softened wet with cloth, then the special pushing board is used, and then scratched and scraped with oil one time after another, which makes the skin smoother and ﬂatter, and the contraction of the skin can be relieved before drawing.

                </h5>
                <div class="content">
                    Tools for carving artists are generally knife, wax board, drawing needle, scissors and so on. The speciﬁcations and sizes of the knife should be easy for use. The wax plate is cushioned under the skin. Cover the drawing on the skin, and use the knife for ﬁne machining.Carving can be divided into positive carving and intaglio. Positive carving is commonly referred to as “empty bottom”. Only lines are left in the manuscript, which is set against a shadow window. It can produce a strong contrast effect and can be used to carve the face; the intaglio is the general “solid background”, leaving a large area for further carving, it can be used when dealing with clothing and patterns. There are a lot of carving techniques. The beginning and ﬁnishing point of the cutting edge of the knife is called the blade of the knife. The blade of the knife takes the forms of fracture, sharp, level, and round. The level carving is mostly used in the carving of standard square images, such as desk, box, cupboard, building, etc., the sharp carving is used for the smoke, cloud, water wave, wind belt, etc. the Arc cutting edge is used for ﬂower pattern, can also be used in character features or hair; sawtooth edge and straight line cutting edge are used in collars, hat edge and other places.

                <div class="content">
                    After carving, it comes to painting. According to the characteristics of animal skin, collect the corresponding chemical pigments, bearing the compositions and dose in the bottom of the heart. The processing is ﬁrst to put the pure color into a larger container, then put in several pieces of transparent glue made of ﬁne skin, then put the container on a special lamp holder, and light the alcohol lamp at the bottom, so that it can dissolve into porridge with the glue color. Apply it to the puppets while it is hot. There are three methods of dyeing: coloring, dizziness, and drawing. Coloring is to make changes in the hue color, dyeing from shallow and deep in a gradation effect with natural transitions. Smudging is to enhance the sense of three-dimensional for its natural fullness. The drawing was made to highlight the outline. The painted skin will be re-processed again.Brush again on tung oil, before the completion.

                </h5>
                <div class="content">
                    The shadow puppets need sweating and dehydration after coloring, the aim is to volatilize the moisture retained in the skin and the colors will permeate into the skin at a suitable high temperature. There are many methods of sweating and dehydration, some of which are clamped with thin boards and pressed under the mat of the hot Kang (a heatable brick bed in North China); others are wrapped in ﬂat cloth to be ironed with soldering iron or electric iron; another very old method tradition is to use adobe or brick to form a herringbone, then heat it with burning wheat straw, ﬂatten the shadow and make it sweated and dehydrated.

                    In order to enable the shadow puppets to move freely, the whole body of the leather pieces should be split into heads, chest, waist, hands, legs, buttocks and other parts, respectively, then tied with wire or linen wire. In addition, joysticks must be added, depending on the number of roles, if the elegance of the female role is to be demonstrated, multiple joysticks will be used.
