                    Shadow is a puppet play. The puppet aims to eliminate the evil spirit, reward God and send God, and this also exists within the shadow play. Some people believe that the description of Emperor Tang Mingwang's meeting with Yang Guifei after death in Bai Juyi's The Song of Everlasting Sorrow was the basis for the appearance of shadow plays at that time. Wang Hao's description in Lin Tian Xu Lu(Records of the Forests and farmlands) in Yuan Dynasty meant the same, “to perform with puppet and wood in the play while decorated with colorful fancy papers, to tell the stories, to prey for good luck and to drive away the evil spirits.” Till Ming and Qing dynasties, this function still existed. In the Qing Dynasty, the shadow also experienced several ups and downs because of the nature of the puppet play. First, during the time of Jiaqing under the reign of Renzong, as a result of a civil riot, it was said that the shadow artists could be turned into “heavenly generals & soldiers” to help the people, so that the government authorities raided the city's shadow troupes and captured artists, making the shadow arts almost perish. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, people's livelihood was low, riots sprung up frequently, and there was a rise of White Lotus Society. The Qing government arrested the shadow entertainers on the charge of “ abstruse lamp bandits” by saying that they would use paper to entertain evil spirits and revolt. Even at the time of Emperor Guang Xu's death, he issued a notice banning the performance of shadow plays, saying that “the state is in great trouble and the people have no good nature. If they sing and perform again, they will arouse greater riots.”

                    The education function has two meanings, one is that shadow serves for religious propaganda; the other is the social responsibility of illuminating and strengthening social ethics and justice. Shadow puppets serve to preach dogma. The ﬁrst is to propagandize the thoughts of Buddhism. From “Lantern Folk Talk” to “Hanging Lantern, Preaching” in Song Dynasty is to let the general public bathe in the well-being of the Buddha. Later, shadow play was called “Taoist shadow” in some places, Taoist roamed the world and preached all over the country when singing in the form of shadow, followed by patterns and plots. The shadow play also regards the puriﬁcation of social atmosphere as its own responsibility, to talk about the Romance of History and to distinguish loyalty from Traitors, combines praise and demoralization; propagandizes Confucian loyalty, ﬁlial piety, good and evil, illuminate ethics; and tells folk legends and stories, elaborates joys and sorrows, and exhorts good deeds, which is full of civilized social functions. Even in the countryside where culture was inaccessible, ordinary people were able to get orthodox education after watching the shadow.

                    Shadow play has deep root in the folk. It makes a serious theme more common and a major theme understandable. Notes on Yenching's Age: the performance of the shadow is very vivid, the intricate and moving plots, when singing sad, some old women often can not help but shed tears. This shows that the appeal of shadow play is very strong. Shadow plays are always closely linked to rural production and life. Puppets for the day, shadow singing for the night, which brings people lively and active folk life, enriches people's interest in life, but also becomes the reason and media for people to communicate with.

                    Shadow is a comprehensive art. It consists of the qualities of graphic plastic art, performance accompaniment and script, and the qualities of opera music, so it reﬂects the historical development process of folk art. Shadow is a transparent graphic art. It mainly absorbs paper-cut modeling methods, and at the same time integrates the features of facial composition, murals, sculptures, stone sculptures, carving, tanning, arrowhead and other techniques. It often takes only a few lines to create the play roles of Sheng (young male role), Dan (young female role), Jing (painted face), Chou (comedian) in the plays. The characters are characterized by both shapes and spirits. There are also recognizable symbols on the costumes of the characters. The age of the character, the needs of the plot, must be combined and coordinated with different ﬁrst stubbles and bodies. The shadow makes full use of the principle of light and shadow, uses the effects expressed by the white screen, and achieve these effects by carving special images to break through the limits of time and space, cross the sea and drill into the earth.
