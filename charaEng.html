                    The aria of Tangshan shadow is based on Laoting dialect. Before the formal formation of vocal art, there was only pure Hem singing; till the Ming and Qing dynasties, shadow has taken the form of opera singing. In Xianfeng years of Qing dynasty, local artists invented singing with choked voice, using their hands to control the vocal cords, so that the voice is high or low. The singing is divided into ﬂat, ﬂoral, desolate, Huanyang tune and the sad tune. The Flat Tune is a singing tune of purity and chastity, ﬂoral for Dan, sad tune for a variety of characters expressing grief and sad tune is specially used by Dan.

                    Hunan shadow approximates Hubei shadow in style, with the modeling perfectly round. Before Emperor Guang Xu of Qing Dynasty, the shadow was made of cattle leather, with seventy percent on the face to demonstrate the appearance and the solid background painted with color. The ﬁgure is rough and colorless. Since the end of Qing Dynasty and the beginning of the Republic of China, folk artists have used seven layers of paper papered as cardboard instead of oxen for carving, ﬁnally coloring, waxing, and embedding transparent colored paper on their clothing, that is, the making of “paper shell with positive carving, lined with colored transparent paper”, which was unique in the national shadow plays. In recent decades, the shadow face makeup have been taking celluloid as the material, shaded with color painting, and operated with only one arm.

Both Lingyuan and Kazuo shadow plays of Chaoyang area of western Liaoning, which are at the neighboring of Hebei Province, have been mostly inﬂuenced by the Luanzhou Shadow play, and the singing style similar to that of Tangshan Shadow, Laoting Shadow. Lingyuan Shadow spoken parts need to use “Laoting Tune”, more is the choking voice, tactful and delicate singing with high mellow voice.The shadow operas in other areas are directly inﬂuenced by Errentuo, Northeast Drum, folk songs, especially dialect intonation. Speciﬁcally, Laohe, Benghe, Heishui, Sanchuan and other places in Jianping County are located in western Liaoning Province; the shadow singing style is rougher with regional characteristics of western Liaoning. The shadow of southern Liaoning has the division of the south school and the north school, each has its own merits. There are also differences in the same area: Anshan Shadow Drama, for example, has formed a strong vernacular chamber music. While about 90% of the Xiuyan population of southern Liaoning is the Manchu nationality, Xiuyan Shadow opera and Manchu culture are constantly merged, gradually absorbing the local Manchu single-drum, Northeast Drum, the song-and-dance duet, Northeast yangko and other tunes, formed a strong local style of singing and shadow words; Gaizhou Shadow takes use of local colloquialism in its creation, such as the local slang for vernacular, unique singing style, thus forming its own unique tune, its music & singing is mainly divided into three kinds as shadow tune, external tune, miscellaneous tune.

                    The puppets of Door-god are larger, about 70cm high, carved with cowhide. Early shadow maker ground paper into paper pulp for carving, with cowhide, shadow puppet is relatively thick. The early performers carved in paper made from paper pulp, then made of cowhide, with a relatively thick silhouette. The facial makeup borrows from that of other resources, such as Peking Opera; the hand is ﬁve-ﬁngered; the face is round in outline and thick in lines. The female takes the curved moon-like eyebrows, the male straight eyebrows. Puppet clothing is a ﬂat pattern that does not care much about the actual effect, but has a certain distribution of symmetrical patterns. The crowns are diversiﬁed, and the real mustaches should be used. It is a more ancient tradition with the simple carving, realistic facial makeup.<br/>
                    Hankou Shadow is about one and a half feet tall, carved with cowhide and separated heads and hats.

This singing method is called “Haoshui”, while two and three ﬁshing drum artists sit and sing, which is called “meditation singing.” Mianyang Fishing Drum has ﬁve major music arias, namely: Flat opera, Sad opera, Fishtail opera (also known as Fengwei opera), Pipa opera, Miscellaneous Flower opera; with the artist Gong Benhuai’s development and creation, there are now more than 20 kinds of tunes, such as Xinping opera, Female ﬂat opera, several plates, and so on.

                    Longdong shadow excels at the use of exaggerated deformation, the puppets take big head and small body, the ﬁgures are wide in its upper part and narrow in its lower part, with arms reaching over the knee. Facial images are generally the side, except some individual clowns, ghosts, which are 3/4 of the half side. The designs of facial makeup are basically the same as Qin Opera, in Guanzhong Area, Shaanxi Province, with black representing the loyal, white representing the traitors, red the brave, empty (that is, positive carving) the just. Among them, the painted face is the whole face dominated by one main color, with red, green, black, yellow and pink to match. Painted face, or the broken face, that is the face carved according to the structure of the face, or based on a certain animal plant or natural pattern, with one dominant color, other colors as the auxiliary. The outline of the image is concise and straight, the internal carving is intricate, precise, and smooth; and attention is paid to the decorative effect of the pattern; the carving colors are strong in contrast, lively and bright; the combination between the parts of the body of the shadow puppets is decomposed and reasonable, so the performance is very ﬂexible, full of embodiment of the coarse and the ﬁne, the bold and the elegant artistry.
